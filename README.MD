# Book Review App
This is a simple app for handling book reviews.  It really just exists because it's an excuse to write some golang....

## Running
1.  `git clone` this repository.
    * The repo MUST be installed in $GOPATH/src/kraftykai/breview/ for `go install` to work
1.  Install all dependencies with `go get ./...`
1.  Install the application `go install`
1.  `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`
1.  Assuming your PATH et el are set correctly you can just `breview -h` to figure out the rest.
